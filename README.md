# codewars-directions-reduction
### From the CodeWars kata "Direction Reduction". The function takes 'north','south','east', and 'west' directions and eliminates any unecessary movements such as moving north then south or east then west just to be back at the point of origin again. The function efficiently returns the only direction necessary to reach the point of destination.
